# Heap

## Abstract

Heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the property: every parent node must be either greater than or equal to(max heap) or less than or equal to(min heap) its children. 
Heap has not to be sorted. 
There is no particular relationship among nodes on any given level or among the siblings, but between every parent and its children.
Usually, if people discuss a heap, it points to a binary heap.

# Binary Heap

## Abstract

When a heap is a complete binary tree[^1], it is called a binary heap. Binary heap has a smallest possible height: a heap with **N** nodes and **a** branches will always has $log_aN$ height. 
For example, a binary heap with 10 nodes and 2 branches, its height would be $log_210$, which is close to 3.321. The result 3.321 means that nodes occupy a bit more than the $3^{rd}$ level, so after rounding up, the height is 4.

## Complexity

Here are some complexities in binary heap: space/build/insert/delete/search/peek

| Overall Complexity
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Algorithms | Average | Worst case
| space | O(n) | O(n)
| build | O(n log n) | O(n log n)
| insert | O(1) | O(log n)
| delete | O(log n) | O(log n)
| search | O(n) | O(n)
| peek[^2] | O(1) | O(1)

[^1]: test
[^2]: peek is an operation on certain data types, particular to some sequential structures such as stack, queue, heap, which can get the value of the top(front) of the structure without removing the element. This operation gets the same value as "pop()" or "top()".
